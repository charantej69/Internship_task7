# How Malicious Browser Extensions Can Harm Users

Common malicious behaviors:
- Injecting ads or tracking scripts into pages (monetization).
- Rewriting search results or redirecting traffic to affiliate links.
- Collecting form data and credentials (keylogging or form-scraping).
- Using permissions to read/modify content on all visited sites.
- Installing additional native helpers or using nativeMessaging to run system commands.
- Persisting by re-installing through companion helper apps or syncing via account.

Indicators of compromise:
- New bookmarks, settings or search engine changed without consent.
- Excessive CPU/network usage tied to the browser process.
- Pop-ups or ads appearing on sites that never had them.
- Browser home/new tab/search engine changed unexpectedly.

Sources & further reading:
- Look for security research from reputable vendors (e.g., ESET, Kaspersky, Google Safe Browsing) when investigating suspicious extensions.
